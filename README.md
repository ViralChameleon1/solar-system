# Solar System Simulation

This project is a 3D solar system simulation built using **Three.js**, with features such as realistic planetary movement, texture mapping, and camera control.

## Features
- **3D Solar System**: Visual representation of the Sun and planets.
- **Textures**: Planets have realistic textures applied.
- **Lighting**: Dynamic lighting for realistic rendering.
- **Interactive Camera**: The camera starts close to the solar system and can be controlled.

## Technologies Used
- **Three.js**: JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics.
- **HTML5**: For structuring the project.
- **CSS**: For basic styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For the logic and interactions in the simulation.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ViralChameleon1/solar-system-simulation.git
2.Navigate to the project directory:
  cd solar-system-simulation
3. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the simulation.

## Usage
- **Controls**: Interact with the simulation by using mouse or touch events to rotate and zoom the camera.
- **Explore**: Observe the planetary movements and the solar system's dynamics.
